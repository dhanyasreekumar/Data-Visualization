> Borrowers who completed their loans have a higher credit score.

> Smaller the proosper score, higher the borrower rate and vice versa.

> The interest rate generally increases as more days past the due date for loan payment.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> An important insight we get is that the interest rate generally increases as more days past the due date for loan payment. We also see that the lower income groups are the ones who pay the highest interest rate. This can be because that since lower income groups are the most likely to delay payment hence the loan passes due date, the have to pay higher interest rates.
